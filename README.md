# Dice-Rolling-Simulator
This program will allow the user to emulate rolls of any number and any type of dice.

The user can input the desired roll to generate as xDy+z format, where "x" stands for the amount of dice to roll,
"y" for the dice type (for example D6 would be a six-sided die, and D20 would be a 20-sided die), and "z" is an optional
modifier the user can provide, that will be added or subtracted from the total result.

The program will display a list of the rolls on each individual die, and the result of their total sum, including the
optional modifier if provided.
